# makingof
- going to try and setup a coding/monospace theme/layout. i have a feeling i'll push more terminal apps, interactions, etc... text/monospace/terminal will make sure i can have more standardize ui across different platforms.
- credit where credit is due. thank https://thomasf.github.io/solarized-css/ for the starting point with the color codes
- getting hungry... we'll get back to this tomorrow

# todo
- setup 


# what is the steam about
- easier to parse out a couple of things:
- most basic reason - it's fun/entertaining/enjoyable to do. dipped my toe in the streaming pool last year. plans got disrupted a little. like for a lot of people... but it was fun. so lets try again, it's a new year, as good a time as any
- it's a fun way to do/frame side projects. 
- it would be fun to have a long term?/continuous project instead of a ponctual one? like build an app. app will have feature creep, deliveries,accumulation of cruft, etc... but streaming is just the doing in itself. if i'm going to stream according to a scheduel, i have to do it on that schedule. i can't find a clever solution to not implement something, or change requirements, get stuck with a bug, issue, design flaw... it just has to be done.
- i want to try a few different projets. well more than a few. havaing an external force selecting one to focus on might be beneficial. it's not like having a boss or client, but it could be fun to have enough of an audience to have actual people want to have a certain project to continue.
- there are a couple of fun things/project/concepts that i need to work out a bit more before trying them out, but they are related to streaming so... yeah, i need to actually stream to try them
- because of teh pandemic/lockdowns/etc... i work from home. so have about 2hrs of commute i don't need to do. it'd be nice to have something positive to look back to. that i used this additional time for something more than just more tv/games/whatever i spend all my time on... so hard to tell when everythnig blurs together
